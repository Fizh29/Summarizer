Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in text summarization, a process of condensing a large document into a concise version while preserving its core meaning. This technology has become increasingly important in managing the overwhelming amount of textual data produced daily, such as articles, research papers, and reports. Text summarization can be approached through extractive methods, which identify and pull key sentences directly from the text, or abstractive methods, which involve generating new sentences to create a summary that resembles human writing. By leveraging algorithms and machine learning models, NLP enables faster and more accurate summarization, making it an essential tool for industries like media, education, and business to extract valuable insights from extensive content efficiently.
